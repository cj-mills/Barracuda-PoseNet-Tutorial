# Barracuda PoseNet Tutorial - Version 1

![](https://github.com/cj-mills/christianjmills/raw/master/images/barracuda-posenet-tutorial/part-6/pose_skeleton_480p_90c.gif)

This tutorial series provides step-by-step instructions for how to perform human [pose estimation](https://www.fritz.ai/pose-estimation/) in [Unity](https://unity.com/) with the [Barracuda](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.0/manual/index.html) inference library. We’ll be using a pretrained [PoseNet](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5) model to estimate the 2D locations of key points on an individual’s body.
